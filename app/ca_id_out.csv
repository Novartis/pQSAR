description,SANGER: Inhibition of human HDLM-2 cell growth in a cell viability assay.,"Kinase Glo Assay: Human RSK2 protein, purchased from Invitrogen, is used to measure kinase activity utilizing Kinase Glo Plus (Promega) a homogeneous assay technology, which uses a luciferin-luciferase based ATP detection reagent to quantify residual ATP. The assay is performed using 0.75 nM His-RSK2, 0.75 uM ATP and 1.0 uM S6 Kinase/RSK Substrate Peptide 1 (Upstate, catalog #12-124), in assay buffer consisting of 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM MnCl2, 50 mM KCl, 0.2% BSA, 0.01% CHAPS, 100 uM Na3VO4, 0.5 mM DTT, and 1% DMSO. Solutions of test compounds at various concentrations are prepared by 1:3 fold serial dilution of a 1 mM solution of compound in DMSO. The DMSO solutions are further diluted with assay buffer to a final concentration of DMSO of 5%.The assay is performed in a 384 well, white, non-binding plate (Corning, catalogue #3574). Solutions of test compounds (10 uL) are transferred to a dry assay plate, followed by addition of 20 uL kinase.",Inhibition of rat liver dihydrofolate reductase,"Bromodomain Domain Binding Assay: A time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) assay was used to determine the affinities of compounds of the Examples listed in Table 1 for each bromodomain of human BRD4. His-tagged first (BD1: amino acids K57-E168) and second (BD2: amino acids E352-E168) bromodomains of human BRD4 were expressed and purified. An Alexa647-labeled BET-inhibitor was used as the fluorescent probe in the assay. Compound dilution series were prepared in DMSO via a 3-fold serial dilution from 2.5 mM to 42 nM. Compounds were then diluted 6:100 in assay buffer (20 mM Sodium Phosphate, pH 6.0, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt dihydrate, 0.01% Triton X-100, 1 mM DL-Dithiothreitol) to yield 3× working solutions. Six microliters (L) of the working solution was then transferred to white, low-volume assay plates (Costar #3673). A 1.5× assay mixture containing His-tagged bromodomain, Europium-conjugated anti-His antibody (Invitrogen PV5596) and the Alexa-647-conjugated probe molecule was also prepared. Twelve L of this solution were added to the assay plate to reach a final volume of 18 L. The final concentration of 1× assay buffer contains 2% DMSO, 50 M-0.85 nM compound, 8 nM His-tagged bromodomain, 1 nM Europium-conjugated anti-His-tag antibody and 100 nM or 30 nM probe (for BDI or BDII, respectively). After a one-hour incubation at room temperature, TR-FRET ratios were determined using an Envision multilabel plate reader (Ex 340, Em 495/520).",,,,
